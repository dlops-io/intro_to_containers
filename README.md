# Introduction to Development using Containers

## Prerequisites
* Have Docker installed
* Cloned this repository to your local machine with a terminal up and running
* Check that your Docker is running with the following command

`docker run hello-world`

### Install Docker 
Install `Docker Desktop`

#### Ensure Docker Memory
- To make sure we can run multiple container go to Docker>Preferences>Resources and in "Memory" make sure you have selected > 4GB

### Install VSCode  
Follow the [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating system.  
If you already have a preferred text editor, skip this step.  

### Clone the github repository
- Clone or download from [here](https://github.com/dlops-io/intro_to_containers)


## Make sure we do not have any running containers and clear up an unused images
* Run `docker container ls`
* Stop any container that is running
* Run `docker system prune`
* Run `docker image ls`

## Frontend App Container

### Initial Exercise

* Build image by running `docker build -t frontend-app -f Dockerfile .`
* Run container by running `docker run --rm --name frontend-app -ti frontend-app`

* Can we see the index.html inside the `frontend-app` container?
* Since `http-server` is installed in the container we can run it by typing `http-server` in the docker shell
* Go to `http://localhost:8080/` on a browser and do we see anything?

* Where is our index.html?

* Now exit the `frontend-app` container and run `docker run --rm --name frontend-app -ti --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app frontend-app` for windows put in your current working directory path
* Run `http-server` in the docker shell

* Go to `http://localhost:8080/` on a browser and do we see anything?

* We need to expose the port `8080` from the container to the host so that we can access the web site running inside the `frontend-app` container

* Now exit the `frontend-app` container and run `docker run --rm --name frontend-app -ti --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app -p 8080:8080 frontend-app` for windows put in your current working directory path

* Run `http-server` in the docker shell

* Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and Yeah!!! you should see our app in the browser


### Best Practice we will be using
* Rather that type in all the commands for `docker build` and `docker run` with all the parameters each time going forward we will write them into a `docker-shell` file so that it is easier for us to use and also can be share by your team member so the container is started up in the exact way by everyone


### Starting the Container
Type the command 
-  `cd frontend-app`
- Run `sh docker-shell.sh` or `docker-shell.bat` for windows

To install a new node package use `npm install <package name>` from the docker shell

To run development web server run `http-server` from the docker shell

Test the API service by going to `http://localhost:8080/`

## Download Images Container
### Starting the Container
First let is create a `persistent-folder` that will be used to save the downloaded images and also mounted to multiple containers so we can share content between containers.
- Create a folder `persistent-folder` at the same level as our container folders. So you should have your directories like this:
```
├── api-service
├── database-server
├── download-images
├── frontend-app
└── persistent-folder
```

Type the command 
-  `cd download-images`
- Run `sh docker-shell.sh` or `docker-shell.bat` for windows

in the `download-images` directory to startup (build and run) the docker container. The container contains a Linux kernel and will install all dependencies for the image downloader. Running this command for the first time will take around 90 seconds (depending on the system you're using). This command automatically builds and runs the Docker container, where you should automatically be entered into the Linux kernel in the **app** Python virtual environment.

If you `exit` the Docker container, and run the command `docker images | grep download-images`, you'll see some nice information about the image name, tag, image ID, creation date, and size

### Running Downloader
Now that you are inside the Docker container, run the example command

`python -m cli --nums 10 --search "oyster mushrooms" "crimini mushrooms" "amanita mushrooms" --opp "search"`

`python -m cli --opp "verify"`

where 
- `nums` is the number of images to download
- `search` contains the search terms
- `opp` is the operation whether to `search` or `verify` the images

Images will be downloaded in a sub-directory named *persistent-folder/dataset*

## API Service Container
### Starting the Container
Type the command 
-  `cd api-service`
- Run `sh docker-shell.sh` or `docker-shell.bat` for windows

To install a new python package use `pipenv install requests` from the docker shell

To run development api service run `uvicorn_server` from the docker shell

Test the API service by going to `http://localhost:9500/`

## Exercise

Since we have 3 containers running let's access data across them:

### 1) Read the list of of images downloaded by the `download-images` from the `api-service` container and expose it as a REST API

* Add a new route (A Fast API method to generate a REST API) to return a list of labels and path
* Add this code block to the api/service.py:
```
@app.get("/get_demo_images")
async def get_demo_images():

    label_names = glob(os.path.join(dataset_path, '*'))
    print("Labels:", label_names)

    # Generate a list of labels and path to images
    data_list = []
    for label in label_names:
        # Images
        image_files = os.listdir(label)
        data_list.extend([(label.split("/")[-1], os.path.join(dataset_path, label, f))
                         for f in image_files])

    print("Full size of the dataset:", len(data_list))
    print("data_list:", data_list[:5])

    # Convert to json
    data_list = [{'label': itm[0], 'path':itm[1]} for itm in data_list]

    return data_list
```
* Go to `http://localhost:9500/get_demo_images` and what do you see?

### 2) Call the REST API from our Frontend App
* In our `frontend-app` container we will add a javascript code block to talk to the backend to read the list of data and display it in HTML
* Open `index.html` file and add this code block in the `<script></script>` section:
```
    # Add in script to pull demo data 
    // API URL
    var BASE_API_URL = 'http://localhost:9500/';
    axios.defaults.baseURL = BASE_API_URL;

    function build_image_list() {
        // Get a reference to the UI element image_list_container
        var image_list_container = document.getElementById("image_list_container");

        axios.get('/get_demo_images')
            .then((response) => {
                console.log(response.data);

                // build list
                let list = "<ol>";
                response.data.forEach(function (item, index) {
                    list += "<li>" + item["label"] + " : " + item["path"] + "</li>"
                });


                list += "</ol>"

                image_list_container.innerHTML = list;
            });
    }

    // Call Build image list
    build_image_list();
```

* Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and what do we see now?
